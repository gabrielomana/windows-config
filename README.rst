Step 1: Run PowerShell Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open a PowerShell console with administrator permissions.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the scripts.
3. Execute the following command to allow script execution in PowerShell:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

4. Execute the following command to start the Windows settings script:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      .\1-tweak_windows.ps1

Step 2: Application Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the `2-install_apps.ps1` file in a text editor.
2. Inside the file, locate the section related to the applications you want to install.
3. To install an application, remove the `#` symbol at the beginning of the corresponding line. To disable installation, add the `#` symbol. For example, the following shows that in the web browsers section, Firefox and Brave will be installed, but Chrome will not:

   Example:

    ::

        #### WEB BROWSERS ####
        ## Firefox: Fast and secure web browser.

        winget install --id=Mozilla.Firefox --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements --silent -e

        ## Brave: Fast and privacy-focused browser.

        winget install --id=Brave.Brave --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements --silent -e

        ## Chrome: Fast and secure web browser by Google.

        #winget install --id Google.Chrome --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements --silent -e

4. Save the changes to the file.
5. After editing and saving the changes, open a new PowerShell terminal with administrator permissions.
6. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the scripts.
7. Execute the following command to allow script execution in PowerShell:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

8. Execute the following command to start the Windows settings script:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      .\1-tweak_windows.ps1
